SLOWProxy/WIProxy
======
Super Lightweight Open-source Wasted Proxy, aka. SLOWProxy, is a proxy software that actually mainly focusing on the efficiency and flexibility, and is written in C. Currently, the only natively supported platform should be Linux.

Some development builds may be called Wobbly Insecure Proxy, aka. WIProxy, which should not be deployed in production environment, as it may ignore security settings and mainly for testing and protocol-verification purposes.

The whole project is still in a very early designing phase.
